 I am thinking about how to structure the thesis to limit the reading list
 to a manageable expression.  

I might have a somewhat clear idea of what to put in the first chapter:
background on the Cold War and the computer, Simon's place in the context
of the creation of the computer, and Simon's history between the computer
and artificial intelligence. This part could benefit from relating the
computer to artificial intelligence. After all, Simon did write about the
computer in his writings, but as far as I am aware, he spoke more about
artificial intelligence than about computers per se. 

Perhaps, in that sense, it would be worth it to look at all of Simon's
explicit writings on the computer \ldots it seems I would need to read, on
top of «Administrative Behavior», his «The Sciences of the Artificial». I
would like to limit the amount of books to read for the thesis, but it
seems unavoidable to read one book on the history of the computer. Should I
fall short of time, it should be Edward's «The Closed World».

As in my previous discussion with Prof. Lenfant, we agreed that
introducing the topic of artificial intelligence is more difficult than it
appeared at first sight, we might be forced to talk more about the
organization of labor rather than artificial intelligence. In fact thinking
about it, we should, perhaps, forget about artificial intelligence at this
point, and talk about the computer as a social technology. 

I am beginning to sense that the biggest challenge at this point really is
choosing the corpus. The problem is that if the topic is to broad as to
require a vast amount of reading to treat satisfactorily, the thesis will
be ambitious but an utter failure. The topic must be adjusted to reduce the
reading to an amount that is manageable within the time constraints and
that allows a satisfactory treatment of the subject. 

Today, I am checking Simon's «Models of Bounded Rationality, Vol 3.», which
was published in 1997, just a few years before his death. Vol. 1 dates
from 1982. Vol. 2 from 1982 (1984 the softcover edition). It is very likely
that the motivation for this collection comes from his receiving the Nobel
Prize in Economics in 1978. In other words, there is a 15 year gap between
the first volumes and the third. It would be interesting to find out the
history behind the motivation for the publication of the third volume, but
this would be impossible to undertake at this point. 

The following is the description of Vol. 2 from the MIT Press website:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Herbert Simon in 1978. At
Carnegie-Mellon University he holds the title of Professor of Computer
Science and Psychology. These two facts together delineate the range and
uniqueness of his contributions in creating meaningful interactions among
fields that developed in isolation but that are all concerned with human
decision-making and problem-solving processes. In particular, Simon has
brought the insights of decision theory, organization theory (especially as
it applies to the business firm), behavior modeling, cognitive psychology,
and the study of artificial intelligence to bear on economic questions.
This has led not only to new conceptual dimensions for theoretical
constructions, but also to a new humanizing realism in economics, a way of
taking into account and dealing with human behavior and interactions that
lie at the root of all economic activity.

The sixty papers and essays contained in these two volumes are grouped
under eight sections, each with a brief introductory essay. These are: Some
Questions of Public Policy, Dynamic Programming Under Uncertainty;
Technological Change; The Structure of Economic Systems; The Business Firm
as an Organization; The Economics of Information Processing; Economics and
Psychology; and Substantive and Procedural Reality.

Most of Simon's papers on classical and neoclassical economic theory are
contained in volume one. The second volume collects his papers on
behavioral theory, with some overlap between the two volumes. The second
edition of Simon's widely read and referenced The Sciences of the
Artificial was published by The MIT Press 1981 and is available in both
hardcover and paperback.
#+END_QUOTE

From the preface to Vol. 3, it seems to me that Simon had a big say on what
papers were chosen for these volumes. He claims that the papers contained
therein have historical interest. They constitute, to his judgment, the
principal papers in economics. Thus, as we can infer from the introduction
to the third volume, since these papers do not get into his published
books, taking those aside, these papers constitute the /principal/ papers
Simon wrote dealing with economics according to his personal appreciation.

Simon claims that the reason the categories used in Vol. 3 doesn't match
those of the previous volumes is that his interests changed dramatically.
Apparently, vol. 3 includes mostly papers from the 1980s and 1990s, such as
formal representation of causal ordering (closely connected with the
identification problem) in dynamic systems., the implications for our
society of the new information systems that are being generated as products
of the rapid deveoplment of computers and electronic communication
networks, and the nature of employee and managerial motivation in the
bvusiness firm, and the implications for economics of the propensity of
human beings to identify with the goals of organizations, and the state of
economics itself (its changing attituted toward formal theory vis-à-vis
empirical research). It is interesting that the topic of the apllication of
economics to governmental administration and policy, and rational choice
under uncertainty and technological change are hardly represented in this
volume. 

Use the following guide when comparing the changes in Simon's thought
between the two volumes:

|-----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| The Structure of Complex Systems              | Causes and Possible Worlds              |

In any case, for now I think we better just finish up the three papers we
had begun reading: the one by Hunter Heyck, the two by Simon. Then, we can
discuss what to read next, although the papers in Vol. 3 dealing with the
impact of communications technologies seem to be next. Likewise, reading
«Administrative Behavior» seems to be a must. For now, let's stay clear of
books on the computer, for they may not be relevant to Simon's own
thinking: I must find out who were Simon's intellectual forefathers in
terms of thinking about computing. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What I've uncovered in a lot of my work is that nature is used to define
the economy, and the economy is then used to define nature. It's just this
incredible round robin.

\ldots constantly, they are taking these models over and defining the
market to operate like a physical process.

The dominant images of nature have never been very far removed from
dominant images of economic activity. Indeed, many of the same formalism
and ontological commitments tend to cover both, although, the periods of
orthodoxy in the respective fields may move out of phase. Therefore, on the
long horizon of Western thought, nature is not something external that hems
the economy in. Rather, they constitute and mimic one another. For in the
West, it is as hard to sustain the pretense that economy and nature are
pitted in remorseless conflict as it is to acknowledge that Jesus was not a
Caucasian or that money never buys happiness. Philosophers such as Derrida
have made us more aware of the unstable antinomies or, as he dubbed them,
the ghost of the undecidable.

The corpus must not be delimited arbitrarily. Instead, the research
question must be thinkered with to reflect upon a corpus. In other words,
the research question will be the one to determine the corpus. I must
change the research question for it to define an appropriate corpus that
fits the time constraints of the Master's. 

I believe that some way of combining history of ideas (Rabinbach),
sociology of science (Vatin, Meda, Castel), and the work of Herbert Simon
would be nice for a PhD thesis but not for a Master's thesis. For now, we
should reduce our ambitions and \ldots

Taking into accoun the little time left for research, I have decided to
stick to Mendeley for managing pdfs, and instead use a custom bibliography
file to use BibLaTeX's 'origdate' field. As of today, none of BibLaTeX's
default styles use this field, which necessitates redefining a macro, for
it to print at all. Unfortunately, this is the only /reasonable/ modification
available for having this information displayed. Although a LaTeX package,
~chicago-bilatex~ exists, the documentation is extensive (over 150 pages),
which is more than I can afford to read at this moment on 'carpentry'.
After the Master's thesis is completed, time could be devoted to stuyding
this package in detail, but not for now. 

The other problem is that Mendeley does not implement the 'origdate' field
in its templates, which forces me out of it. Should Mendeley implement this
field in future releases, there would be no reason to change, since, as of
today, I haven't come across a better alternative to manage pdfs. Although
people have suggested Zotero, its meager BiBLaTeX support completely
defeats the purpose of using it. Although using Mendeley's collections is
perhaps of little use, since Emacs Org mode is better at organizing those
for research (briefly, Mendely is too slow), keeping files organized in
forlders by 'author', named with the format 'name-year-title', is something
Mendeley excells at. Although using a combination of free software tools
could accomplish the same thing, I prefer having all that in one neat
package that includes pdf highlighting, pdf search, etc. Until a better
alternative arises, Mendeley stays, if only for its powerful organizing
tools.
