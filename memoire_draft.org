** 取 Research Proposal

*** 取 Motivation
 Generally speaking, I am interested in questions of methodology in the
 social sciences. More specifically, I am interested in the role of
 metaphors in the construction of social theories, and the place that these
 have accorded to determinism. Thus, I would like to explore the parallels
 between the understandings---about the essence of nature, society, the
 mind, and the universe---in economics and those in the other natural and
 social sciences. Without any ambition to elevate the regime of truth of
 economics, I am genuinely puzzled by its acceptance by the general public,
 as if economics was a type of discourse about a certain reality with
 portentous social consequences. But what is this social reality that is the
 object of economics? How and why have economists come to think about social
 reality in this way? With this master's thesis, I want to contribute a tiny
 bit towards a better comprehension of this impasse.

 As we have discussed previously, I want to focus my master's thesis around
 Henry Simon; therefore, the question of how he fits into the picture I just
 painted requires an answer. For the record, I am neither sympathetic to
 Simon's vision of the social world nor to his project of a general /science
 of the artificial/. Rather, I decided to structure the thesis around him
 because unlike many neoclassicals of his generation, Simon fully drank the
 cyborg Kool-Aid of the postwar systems sciences, and thus, he took to heart
 the man-machine analogy to its final consequences---to the point where he
 was one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence. Given that
 today artificial intelligence presents itself as the next holy grail of
 science, I find it valuable to write about Simon also as an excuse to study
 more about computer science and its ontology.[fn:2]

*** 取 Subject-matter 
I would like to write about the computer as a political technology,
specially in its guise as the so-called /machine à gouverner/: the ultimate
delegation of political authority and responsibility to machines---or more
generally, to automatic decision mechanisms.[fn:1] Therefore, in this
thesis, I will trace the genealogy of Simon's ideas on the computer and
computation to understand their influence on his views on social
organization. By doing this, I wish to inquire about Simon's pessimism on
the prospects of human rationality and his delegation of decision-making to
"more capable" systems such as machines and organizations.

My opinion, so far, on Simon is that his idea of bounded rationality served
as a kind of excuse to subordinate and reduce the individual to play a very
minor role in social organizations and the conduct of human affairs in
general. And, from what I have read, Simon's epistemic pessimism---which,
by the way, is not too distant from Hayek's---has roots both on a kind of
personal obsession of his with the relation between individual
responsibility and ethical choice,[fn:4] and on his fascination with the
fledgling computer technologies and their prospects. Therefore, in this
master's thesis, I would like to dedicate an important part to Simon's
relation to the computer. This is necessary to account for the importance
of the treatment of information in his theories of organization. In
fact, I surmise that what really preoccupied Simon wasn't 
rationality per se, but information.

In the second part of the thesis, I would like to discuss the political
implications of Simon's ideas on the computer and
computation. Unfortunately, I cannot say more about this, since my reading
hasn't taken me that far, but I will very likely base this section on
Philip Mirowski's /Machine Dreams/ and Paul Edwards's /The Closed
World/. Moreover, in Simon's article /Heuristic Problem Solving: The Next
Advance in Operations Research/, he discusses the relation between Charles
Babbage and Adam Smith's ideas, which echoes a discussion in the second
chapter of /Machine Dreams/ on these same men. I surmise that there could be
some insightful material therein to construct this section. Although, I
would like to mention Babbage and Jevons at some point to compare their
thinking to Simon's, it is unlikely that time will allow for this.

# Since one of the important aspects of Simon's vision of a /Science of the
# Artificial/ is the computer---understood not just as a technology, but as an
# ontology, a vision, a political project, etc.---, this thesis will explore
# Simon's concept of the computer. Hence, the provisional title of the thesis:
# The Automata & the Engineer.

# My aim is to project this thesis into a Ph.D dissertation around the theme
# of the governing machine: the automation of political decision making and
# the delegation of all political responsibility to machines.

# What is interesting is that, just like Hayek's solution to his
# epistemic pessimism was to subordinate mankind to the Market,[fn:3] Simon
# wanted to subordinate mankind to organizations. I could be wrong about it,
# but I do think there are some interesting similarities between these two
# authors. 
**** 完 Main question 
 What is Herbert Simon's definition of the computer? How did this concept
 influence his ideas of /the human/? And, what are the consequences for the
 organization of labor of this vision of man and machine?
**** 完 Secondary Questions 
What was the relation between the natural and the artificial for Simon, and
how does this relation relate to his late-life project of a Science of
the Artificial?

# How does Simon's Science of the Artificial relate to his views on
# economics? And, is his Science of the Artificial compatible with
# neoclassical economics? 

How do Simon's ideas on automation relate to his political views?

# Did Simon draw a clear line between the natural and the artificial, and between
# the human and the inhuman? Likewise, did he subscribe to the unity of

*** 完 Motivation
 Generally speaking, I am interested in questions of methodology in the
 social sciences. More specifically, I am interested in the role of
 metaphors in the construction of social theories, and the place that these
 have accorded to determinism. Thus, I would like to explore the parallels
 between the understandings---about the essence of nature, society, the
 mind, and the universe---in economics and those in the other natural and
 social sciences. Without any ambition to elevate the regime of truth of
 economics, I am genuinely puzzled by its acceptance by the general public,
 as if economics was a type of discourse about a certain reality with
 portentous social consequences. But what is this social reality that is the
 object of economics? How and why have economists come to think about social
 reality in this way? With this master's thesis, I want to contribute a tiny
 bit towards a better comprehension of this impasse.

 As we have discussed previously, I want to focus my master's thesis around
 Henry Simon; therefore, the question of how he fits into the picture I just
 painted requires an answer. For the record, I am neither sympathetic to
 Simon's vision of the social world nor to his project of a general /science
 of the artificial/. Rather, I decided to structure the thesis around him
 because unlike many neoclassicals of his generation, Simon fully drank the
 cyborg Kool-Aid of the postwar systems sciences, and thus, he took to heart
 the man-machine analogy to its final consequences---to the point where he
 was one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence. Given that
 today artificial intelligence presents itself as the next holy grail of
 science, I find it valuable to write about Simon also as an excuse to study
 more about computer science and its ontology.[fn:2]

[fn:4] I am not aware that Simon was a particularly religious man, but these
concerns are quite clearly influenced by christian morality and Simon's
American-style liberal values. 

[fn:3] Or, more precisely, to the products of spontaneously evolving orders
tending towards greater and greater degrees of complexity. 

[fn:2] As Mirowski shows in /Machine Dreams/ (2002), the development of the
computer and its entourage of systems sciences have had profound
consequences for postwar neoclassical economics.

[fn:1] The idea is certainly not Simon's. In fact, as far as I know, the
term /machine à gouverner/ comes from a 1948 article in the newspaper /Le
Monde/, in which a Dominican friar, Père Dubarle, reviewed Norbert Wiener's
book /Cybernetics/. In fact, in his latter book /The Human Use of Human
Beings/ (1950), Wiener explicitly cites and discusses Dubarle's idea.
