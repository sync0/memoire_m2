\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc1f5482}
In the second part of chapter two, this story will be analyzed in the
context of the thought of Herbert Simon about computing and the
organization of labor. As Babbage did, Simon knew about de Prony's project,
which he read using the lens of the mid-twentieth century. In particular,
he read de Prony, and he read Babbage reading de Prony, in the context of
his thinking about a general mathematical science of systems. Unlike
Babbage, Simon thought that machines could literally ``simulate'' human
thinking and human actions to the point where they could replace a lot of
things that humans do. Thinking in the context of a deterministic universe,
Simon thought that humans are no less determined than computers in doing
what they are programmed to do. Thinking that the structure of all systems
is complex and hierarchical, when applied to work, Simon concedes that
worker control over the production process is misguided, and I claim that
this is one of the consequences of his concept of bounded rationality that
is not usually discussed. 

From this perspective, Simon blurred the lines between natural and
artificial systems: using one to describe the other, and vice versa. I
claim that this causes a very dangerous naturalization of the social, which
in the context of discussion about worker control over the productive
process, is perilous for democratic revindications. The fact that epistemic
handicaps are used to argue for worker subordination to the bureaucratic
organization is mistaken, but this is the general ontology that undergirds
thinking about artificial intelligence. 

My point is that to have artificial intelligence really change things for
the better of workers, it is necessary to challenge this naturalization of
the social. As shown in the article of the encyclopedie, technical change
can free workers from toil, and free them to do other activities, but
thinking that what will determine this activity, be it philosophical
contemplation or delivering food on a bicycle depends not exclusively nor
even mostly on the technical feasibility of the tasks in question. Rather,
what this thesis sought was to show that the place and the course of
technical change is also inscribed in the context of social conditions, and
on the thinking about these conditions: thinking about what a worker is,
and their place in society. Whatever has prevented thinking about
technology within broad social context and the thinking about this context,
be it a ``broad church'' positivism among social scientists or the idea
that ``facts'' speak for themselves, the transformations on the future of
labor by the development of artificial intelligence has to be thought about
in this way. Whatever the real technical possibilities of automation due to
artificial intelligence, they can only be realized by questioning also our
thinking about the organization of labor, about the status of subordination
within the working relations, about what it means to be a human, etc.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org0f2bc4b}
From the victory of \textsc{ibm}'s Deep Blue over Gary Kasparov at chess in
1997 to the victory of AlphaGo over Lee Sedol at go in 2016, the progress
of artificial intelligence (AI) in the past two decades has reignited
controversies over the substitutions of humans by super computers. Does the
progress of information and communication technologies (ICTs) drives us to
a world in which ``men are absolutely nothing'', while the ``king, turning
a handwheel alone in an island, carries through automatons all the work of
England''\autocite[330]{sismondi1819_2}?\footnote{My translation.} Regarding the effects on
labor, the disappearance of obsolete jobs and the alleged impoverishment of
the laboring masses preoccupy the optimists in the prospects of automation
\autocite{ford2009}. The problem with contemporary debates about the
automation of human activity, both lay and academic, is their naively
``technicist'' perspective: Could we mechanize this or that task, and at
what cost? What would be the effect of increasing ``computer capital'' on
productivity \autocite{frey_osborne2013}? Can we estimate the impact on the
rate of unemployment \autocite{acemoglu_restrepo2018}?

\section{The Technicist View}
\label{sec:org0c20145}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgebb903a}
For the purposes of this thesis, the ``technicist'' view is defined as the
application of a realist epistemology to the question of the influence of
technology on labor. This view construes \emph{labor} as a historical and
transcultural universal, whose technical characteristics are improved upon
by technology; these changes are thought in terms of the technical
possibilities to automatize a particular task.\footnote{For a discussion of historical universals see the first two chapters
of \textcite{foucault2004}.} Moreover, since jobs
are understood as collections of tasks, if all the tasks composing a job
can be automatized by a firm in a cost-efficient manner, this job is then
believed to disappear in the near future. I contend that many mainstream
economists and many computer scientists who discuss the problem of the
influence of artificial intelligence on the future of labor, be they
pessimists or optimists, hold either this view or one that resembles it.
Since MIT economist David Autor is one of the mainstream economists that
has studied the longest the question of the consequences of automation on
labor, I will analyze his paper \citetitle{autor2015} as an ideal type of the
way mainstream neoclassical economists understand the problem.\footnote{I decided to present the view of an economists and not of, say, a
computer scientist because contemporary society grants economists the last
word on matters regarding labor.}

\subsection{Body}
\label{sec:org735bfdf}

In \citetitle{autor2015}, Autor tries to explain the reasons for the secular
high levels of aggregate employment, despite the advances in labor-saving
technologies. Autor believes that focusing exclusively on job losses is
misguided because understanding the relation between technology and
employment requires thinking about the complementarities of different tasks
with these technologies, the price and income elasticities of different
kinds of outputs, and the labor supply responses. His argument is that
there are certain tasks that cannot be automated but benefit from the
productivity rise of new technologies. Automation, thus, complements and
raises the value of jobs composed primarily of un-automatable tasks by
increasing the demand for labor and raising earnings. Consequently, Autor
believes that commentators often overstate ``the extent of machine
substitution for human labor'' because they ``ignore the strong
complementarities between automation and labor'' \autocite[p.
5]{autor2015}.

To understand how automation affects different jobs in the skills
hierarchy, Autor distinguishes between two sets of tasks that have ``proven
stubbornly challenging to computerize'': ``Abstract'' tasks are those
placed higher in the skill hierarchy, which characterize professional,
technical and managerial occupations that require high education levels,
problem-solving capabilities, inductive reasoning, communication ability,
expert mastery, intuition, and creativity; while ``manual'' tasks are those
placed lower in the skill hierarchy, which characterize for the most part
unskilled occupations (serving, cleaning, janitorial work, in-person health
assistance, etc.) that require situational adaptability, visual and
language recognition, and in-person interactions \autocite[p.
9]{autor2015}. 

Autor believes that abstract task-intensive occupations are strongly
complemented by computer technologies because these enable them ``to
further specialize in their area of comparative advantage'' by spending
less time on ``acquiring and crunching information''
\autocite[p. 15]{autor2015}. Even if wage gains could be mitigated due to
lower expenditures on the outputs of abstract task-intensive activities,
Autor believes that evidence suggests that demand for these services has
kept pace. Most importantly, workers in abstract task-intensive occupations
benefit from the high barriers, such as college and graduate degrees, that
require long years to prepare (i.e., inelastic labor supply).

As for manual-task intensive occupations, which hardly rely on information
or data processing, Autor believes that they benefit from advances in
computer technologies mostly indirectly. For example, the coupling of high
income elasticity of demand for manual tasks-intensive work with rising
aggregate incomes thanks to productivity growth in other areas could raise
demand for manual tasks-intensive occupations. Following Baumol (1967),
Autor believes that ``wages in these occupations \emph{must} rise over time'' to
compensate workers because otherwise they would choose a different
occupation.\footnote{This claim only holds assuming that demand for manual task-intensive
occupations is relatively inelastic \autocite[p. 17]{autor2015}.} That said, Autor recognizes these wage increases will be
limited by the low barriers to entry in these occupations and the labor
supply increase from workers affected by automation and offshoring
\autocite[p. 17]{autor2015}.

Autor discusses these two categories of tasks in the context of ``job
polarization'' \autocite{goos_manning2003}, which refers to the simultaneous
growth of high-education high-wage jobs (professional, managerial,
technical) and low-education low-wage jobs (low paid personal services), at
the expense of middle-wage middle education jobs (skilled blue collar,
clerical, sales). He finds evidence for this phenomenon in the United
States, where middle-skill occupations (sales, office and administrative
workers, production workers, and operatives) have declined from 60 percent
of employment in 1979 to 46 percent in 2012. Citing \textcite{nordhaus2007},
he claims that the dramatic fall in the cost of computing since 1980 rose
the incentives to substitute computers for human labor at the explicit
codifiable tasks---which, he labels ``routine tasks''---that characterize
many middle-skilled cognitive and manual activities. It is precisely these
tasks, Autor believes, that are increasingly performed by machines, which
explains the decline in clerical and administrative support. Job
polarization, however, is unlikely to erase all middle-skill jobs because,
Autor conjectures, many of the tasks that compose middle skill jobs cannot
be unbundled and outsourced to machinery. As a result, middle skill jobs
that combine routine technical tasks and non-routine tasks where humans
still hold a comparative advantage (interpersonal interaction, flexibility,
adaptability, and problem solving) are likely to persist in the following
decades. As for the problem of job polarization leading to wage
polarization, he believes that, while possible, that trend would not
continue indefinitely, except in certain times and specific labor markets.

Furthermore, citing Michael Polanyi's concept of ``tacit knowledge'', Autor
tries to explain the difficulties in automating certain tasks. This concept
refers to an alleged type of knowledge necessary to accomplish certain
tasks, but whose conscious awareness is impossible for whoever possesses
it---we don't know what we know. Autor, then, mobilizes this concept to
explain why tasks ``demanding flexibility, judgment, and common sense''
have proved the most difficult to automate \autocite[p. 11]{autor2015}.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that environmental control and machine
learning could bypass ``Polanyi's Paradox'' and, thus, facilitate the
penetration of automation in heretofore untouched areas: the former by
simplifying the complex environment in which machines operate, and the
latter by inferring heuristic rules of conduct through data
analysis---which would do away with the necessity to know these rules in
advance.

Autor concludes that even though in the last few decades technology has
lead to job polarization, this trend is unlikely to continue because
machines raise the value of the tasks that humans uniquely
provide---problem solving, adaptability, and creativity---through
complementarity effects. Therefore, focusing exclusively on substitution
effects is misguided. He ends the article by claiming that the economic
problem of the future will be one of distribution and not of scarcity.
\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:org8410237}
Although Autor's discussion raises some very important issues, it is marred
by the \emph{epistemological realism} with which he addresses the problem.
Thinking about labor in realist terms---i.e., as if it existed \emph{out there},
independently of our ideas and representations of it---

[here]

However, the limit of these studies is that they interpret the challenge of
automation by artificial intelligence as simply that of estimating with a
macroeconomic model the impacts of the substitution of capital for labor in
employment rates, wages, etc. 

My position in this thesis is that, just as \textcite{schaffer1994} did for
the analysis of automation in Victorian Great Britain, we should analyze
the changes of automation not just as a question of changes in employment
but as a question of changes of labor, the nature of work, and the nature
of the social organization of production. 





discussing many of the most important aspects regarding labor
becomes impossible.

elimination of jobs by technological change as a matter of finding
out whether task \emph{x} can be automated at a low enough cost


As we can see from Autor's discussion, he understands the problem of the
alleged elimination of jobs by technological change as a matter of finding
out whether task \emph{x} can be automated at a low enough cost. Appealing to the
canonical mechanical analogy of the market \emph{mechanism}, Autor finds out that
although labor saving technologies do eliminate certain jobs by increasing
productivity, they do not wipe out people; they just shuffle them around
either at the top or the bottom of the skill pyramid. While he acknowledges
that this situation might pose challenges, he is confident that the market
\emph{mechanism} will watch over those at the bottom by raising salaries in the
long run to keep the janitors away from becoming doctors. 

The technicist view is inadequate because

I contend that a different language that takes into account the social
dimension of labor, thus, is needed.


\section{The Historicity of the Wage Relation}
\label{sec:org32cd75d}
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc38a34e}

Autor's article was presented to glance at the way mainstream economists
think about the impact of automation on labor. I claim that the problem
with this ``technicist'' view is that by relying on a realist epistemology,
it ignore the crucial conventionalist character of social representations
and institutions. For example, the English word \emph{work} refers to both the act
of working and the thing produced, \emph{labor} refers to work in relation to the
``social question,'' and \emph{job} or \emph{occupation} refer (mostly) to the
recognition of a social role by law.\footnote{These definitions are provided in loose form precisely to highlight
their polysemy.} Therefore, by interpreting a job
as simply a collection of tasks, Autor ignores that jobs are codified in
laws that institute certain status, rights, and responsibilities. And, as
is the case for matters in jurisprudence, the issues of definitions,
interpretation, and representations are crucial.

\section{Body}
\label{sec:org861e9f9}

To think about the conventionalist character of these social objects it is
 useful to mobilize Karl Polanyi's concept of fictitious commodities, which
 he introduced to explain how in capitalism \emph{labor}, \emph{land}, and \emph{money} became
 commoditized. Many mainstream economists proceed to analyze the market
 ``dynamics'' of these factor of production, without inquiring about the
 social conditions of possibility that have granted them their status as
 commodities. For example, when Autor claims that ``the elasticity of labor
 supply can mitigate wage gains'', one must wonder, why there is a labor
 supply at all. Contemporary economic analyses takes for granted that there
 will be people willing to work for a wage, but as studies of labor in
 ancient Mesopotamian society have shown, getting others to work for one's
 account is an extraordinarily complex matter
 \autocite[p. 5]{steinkeller2015}. In fact, Steinkeller shows that in
 bronze age Mesopotamia, the problem was often lack of population to cover
 all work needs (demanded mostly by the palaces and temples) and not, as it
 is today, \emph{unemployment} \autocite[pp. 9--19]{steinkeller2015}. The reason
 is to be found in the social and institutional configuration, in which
 most of the peasant citizenry was not alienated from their means of
 subsistence---specifically, arable land. By linking citizenship to
 landownership, Mesopotamian institutions secured for the peasantry a
 certain independence from both public authorities and potential
 ``employers.'' Except for the annual corvee labor provided as is today's
 military service---a mostly non-remunerated public duty---, the peasantry
 had few incentives to work for others, when they could rely on themselves
 and their households.\footnote{Regarding the importance of corvee labor in ancient Mesopotamia and
ancient Egypt, Hudson remarks that the ``Hollywood'' image of slaves
building the pyramids under the scorching sun and the whip of the overseer
is mistaken, for the majority of the labor needed to build these
infrastructures was provided by semi-free labor. He claims that although
slaves and other dependents \emph{did} exist in these societies, they were never
numerous enough to provide the necessary labor requirements
\autocite[p. 649]{hudson2015}.}

Another example of the conventionalist character of labor is the origins of
the work contract. Despite their contemporary ubiquity, the work contract
is a very recent institution, even in Western civilization. As
\textcite{supiot2004_2016} shows for French Civil Law, the ancestor of the
modern work contract (\emph{contrat de travail}) is a lease agreement (\emph{contrat de
louage}), whose origins lie in the Roman \emph{locatio operarum}. Supiot claims
that, regarding the \emph{locatio operarum}, Roman Law reasoned in analogy to the
institution of slavery: Since freemen sold the products of their labor but
not \emph{their} labor, the destitute who worked for the account of others were
thought to lease themselves (\emph{locat se}) as if they leased their slave (\emph{locat
servum}) \autocite[p. 8]{supiot2004_2016}. Following the introduction of
the principles of freedom of business (\emph{liberté du commerce}) and freedom of
industry (\emph{liberté de l'industry}) to work (\emph{travail}) by the Decree d'Allarde
(16 February 1791), the French civil code assimilated the labor relation to
a type of lease. As for the phantasmic object of the work contrat---Is it
the \emph{worker}? Is it the \emph{work}?---, Supiot claims that the possibility to
contractualize work derives from the application of the concept of property
(\emph{patrimoine}) to the relation of \emph{work} to the worker: Since work is the
private property of the worker, he has the right to freely dispose of it on
the market \autocite[pp. 45--66]{supiot1994_2011}.\footnote{This discussion provides only an intuition but not an accurate
description of the significance of these terms in the context of the
jurisprudence. Aside from my lack of competence, the differences between
Civil Law and Common Law compound the difficulty of discussing these terms
unambiguously since they are not equivalent across legal systems. As an
example of the challenge of cross country comparisons in the European
Union, Supiot remarks that even the concept of work contract differs from
country to country \autocite{supiot_et_al1999_2016}.}

As these examples show, the social conditions that push a majority of the
population to sell their labor in exchanges for wages beg an explanation.
These social conditions are what french sociology of work (\emph{sociologie du
travail}) calls the \emph{salariat} (the institution of wage earning). I content
that the \emph{salariat} is often elided in mainstream economic analyses of the
influence of technology on work, but the kernel of the problem of
automation is that of the place that humans will have in that vision of the
world and the transformation of the social conditions of production. An
analysis in terms of the concrete tasks that can (or cannot) be automated,
then, misses the point. This is not to deny that the technical component of
new technologies and specifically artificial intelligence is crucial, but
to advocate for the inscription of these debates within broader legal,
social, and political issues. Thinking that technological changes will
simply do more of the same but faster, while people are moved around as
potatoes by the caprices of the job market is both naive and wrong.
Technological change has to be understood within broader cultural and
historical trends. Taking into account this polyphony allow thinking about
the role of ideas, institutions, and social representations in paving the
way for the introduction of these technologies and their applications in the
workplace.

I do not deny that one day machines might govern, but this would result not
from a coup as in the 1984 movie \emph{Terminator}, but from voluntary regime
change. As recent discussions of the replacement of judges by algorithms
show, the issue is not simply one of the technical prowess of machine
intelligence, but rather one of our own understanding of what constitutes
the ``production'' of justice: If the work of a judge is simply to process
an input---i.e., a case---and compare it to an existing body of law, it is
not far fetched to imagine a textometry algorithm don the gown and the wig
in the near future. But, this automation of justice depends on our
\emph{convening} about the right way to produce justice. Undeniably, ICTs will
facilitate data retrieval, and this will hopefully help judges be better
judges and doctors be better doctors, but the question of the complete
replacement of these jobs by machines is not only a technical but a
conceptual question about what this jobs are actually about. Otherwise, we
risk creating dangerous sociotechnical systems such as those of the 1964
movie \emph{Dr. Strangelove}, in which control of the missile defenses of the
United States and the Soviet Union are automated to erase human error,
resulting in the escalation of nuclear war due to their ``efficient''
retaliation capability out of human control. It may come the day when we
are governed by machines, but this will be a consequence of our convening
that they have the right to govern.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:org5187f67}
However, the limit of these studies is that they interpret the challenge of
automation by artificial intelligence as simply that of estimating with a
macroeconomic model the impacts of the substitution of capital for labor in
employment rates, wages, etc. My position is that this way of framing and
analyzing the problem is not very interesting and offers very little
insight on the wider issue of the changes portended by artificial
intelligence.

My point of view is that many of the various analysis on this matter are
marred by their narrow scope that only focuses on the possible impact of
new technologies on what economists call macroeconomic varibales. Briefly
put, the views of neoclassical or mainstream economists, whether optimists
or pessimists are decided on whatever the economist thinks that the impact
of these technologies will be on macroeconomic variables such as
investment, consumption, employments, wages, etc.

\chapter{Did Adam Smith Invent the Digital Computer?}
\label{sec:orge9af4f4}
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org3575d3a}
On November 14, 1957, in an address to the Twelfth National Meeting of the
Operations Research Society of America, Herbert Simon advanced the
provocative proposition that ``physicists and electrical engineers had
little to do with the invention of the digital computer'', for ``the real
inventor was the economist Adam Smith, whose idea was translated into
hardware through successive stage of development by two mathematicians,
Prony and Babbage.'' \autocite[p. 2]{simon_newell1958}. This provocative
statement was no less controversial then, but is it accurate? 

After establishing, in chapter one, that the technicist view ignores the
historical specificity of the concept of labor, in this chapter, I sketch a
history of the relation between thinking about the possibility of
intelligent machines and thinking about the organization of labor to show
how they have been related in the thought of Charles Babbage and Herbert
Simon. The reason for focusing in these two authors is that Babbage's
construction of a machine called the Analytical Engine is considered
retrospectively by computer scientists to have been the first programmable
computer. As for Simon, he is famous not only as the 19XX Nobel prize in
economics and a great theoretician of administrative science, but also as
one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. The way
this history will be sketched is by analyzing the importance of the project
for the calculation of the logarithmic tables by de Prony by two pioneers
in the history of the computer: Babbage and Simon. The division of labor as
embodied in the allocation of tasks in de Prony's project shows, the first
large \emph{computing} project was not only a project that showed the efficiency
of the distribution of mental labor, but a new form of subordination of the
mind to a particular organization of mental work in which workers were not
only deprived of control but of full knowledge over the productive process.

\section{Manufacturing Logarithms}
\label{sec:org2b8c838}
\subsection{Body}
\label{sec:orged8c157}
Gaspard Clair Francois Marie Riche de Prony (1755--1839) was born in
Chamelet in the Beaujolais region of Southern France to a family of the
provincial middle bourgeoisie---the social class that would fill the ranks
of the Revolution and Empire's bureaucracy \autocite{picon_et_al1984}. After
an education in the Classics, in 1776, at twenty-one, he entered the École
des ponts et chaussées in Paris. Prony's life coincides with a period of
the institutionalization of French sciences and techniques with the
foundation in 1794 of the École polytechnique---where he was appointed
professor of analysis and mechanics with Joseph-Louis Lagrange---and the
École normale supérieure. Moreover, this was a time of growing interest
among the savants for applied problems, and the generalization of the
application of mathematical formalisms.

Following the French Revolution, the recently constituted Assemblée
nationale decided in 1790 to replace the ancient taxes by a land tax
\autocite[p. 6]{peaucelle2012a}.\footnote{According to \textcite{peaucelle2012a}, the assembly was inspired in
this regard by the ideas of physiocratic economist François Quesnay.} Therefore in 1791, the Assemblée
founded the Bureau du Cadastre, with de Prony as director, to conduct a
land survey that would draw the boundaries of landed property in every
French commune.\footnote{Although the Cadastre's initial objective was to assist fiscal
policy by levying land taxes, under Prony's direction, the production of
maps and statistical tables took precedence \autocite[p.
76]{peaucelle2012a}.} In connection with this plan, the revolutionary
government decided that a very large set of logarithmic and trigonometric
tables would be produced to supplement the decimal-based metric system.
This was necessary because the traditional sexagesimal division of the
circle---now regarded as quaint and irrational---was replaced by a decimal
division, which rendered obsolete the older trigonometric tables used by
geodesists and astronomers.\footnote{The decimal division of the circle along with the decimal division
of time were later removed from the metric system \autocite[p.
184]{daston1994}.} So it fell upon de Prony to direct a
project to calculate and print these tables.

De Prony estimated that even with the help of three or four skillful
collaborators, the rest of his life would not suffice to finish the
calculations needed for the tables. One day in front of a book shop, he
spotted ``the beautiful English edition'' of Adam Smith's \emph{Wealth of Nations}
\autocite[p. 7]{firmin-didot1820}. As he opened the book haphazardly, he
stumbled upon chapter one, where Smith discusses the manufacture of pins,
and, suddenly, he conceived the idea to apply the division of labor to the
production of the Cadastre tables ``to manufacture logarithms as one
manufactures pins'' \autocite[p. 35]{prony1824}.\footnote{My translation.} Drawing from his
lessons at the École centrale des travaux publics (later École polytechnic)
on the applications of the method of differences to interpolation, he
conceived a plan to break up the calculation of the final values of the
Cadastre tables into a long series of simpler steps. By using logarithms to
simplify complex operations into additions and subtractions, these
simplified operations could be calculated even by a hairdresser familiar
with only the most rudimentary arithmetic. De Prony, thus, organized the
calculation of the tables by dividing the Cadastre employees into three
sections, following a hierarchy of skill: At the apex, the first section
comprised five or six eminent mathematicians who carried out the analytical
part of the work by choosing the mathematical formulae and the initial
values of the angles. The second section comprised seven or eight
``calculators'', with knowledge of both arithmetic and mathematical
analysis, who derived from the formulae of the first section the values of
the initial logarithms and the initial differences of various
orders.\footnote{At this time, in both French and English, calculator (\emph{calculateur})
referred not to a calculating machine, but to a job.} They also prepared the folio sheets used by the third
section ``by laying out the columns of the chosen values and the first row
of entries'' \autocite[p. 109]{grattan-guinness2003}. Furthermore, they
wrote on the page the instructions to be followed by the third section and
verified their calculations. At the base, the third section comprised
between 60 and 80 calculators who only carried out the additions and
subtractions of the intervals between two numbers, as chosen by the second
section. Prony remarked that ``those who knew more [arithmetic] were not
always those subjected to less errors'' \autocite[p.
53]{prony1804}.\footnote{In his famous article \citetitle{grattan-guinness1990},
Grattan-Guinness claimed that ``[m]any of these workers were unemployed
hairdressers'', but this affirmation, although now widespread, has elicited
controversy \autocite[p. 179]{grattan-guinness1990}. \textcite{roegel2011},
who has closely studied the lists of the employees at the Cadastre,
disagrees with Grattan-Guinness's emphasis on the employment of
hairdressers because he suspects that ``there were only two or three of
them'' \parencite[p. 26]{roegel2011}. Nonetheless, Roegel acknowledges
that the first mention of the hairdressers seems to be an \ordinalnum{11}
November 1824 discourse by engineer Charles Dupin---Prony's close friend---
from which Grattan-Guinness drew upon \parencite{dupin1824}. Moreover, Roegel
claims that the number of computers employed probably never exceeded 20 or
25, so Prony exaggerated his figures. See \textcite{roegel2011}, p. 27, footnotes
96--98). Indeed, a contemporary witness estimates them at about fifteen
\autocite[p. 744]{laLande1803}.} The calculation of the tables began in 1793, and although the
core of the project had been completed by mid-1796, verifications took a
few more years, so that the project was finally completed ``at the end of
the 1790s or the beginning of the 1800s'' \autocite[p. 37]{roegel2011}.

Despite the novel rationalization of the organization of labor that it
promoted, the project of the Cadastre tables was isolated among French
productive activities, which remained mostly artisanal. It was intended as
a ``monument'' to rationality and not a mass produced commodity
\autocite[p. 57]{prony1804}. If the thorough industrialization of French
production would have to wait until the twentieth century, the tables
project was an early example of the application of the engineer mentality
to the organization of labor. This is evidenced in its application of the
division of labor to a hierarchical organization of skills. At the time of
de Prony, even if attitudes towards the \emph{mechanical arts} had been changing
beginning in the ninth century \autocite[p. 10]{vatin_pillon2003_2007},
these were still associated with low ranked repetitive labor devoid of
intelligence.\footnote{In this regard, Friedmann cites the ambivalence in the \emph{Encyclopédie}
of the definition of \emph{artist}:``we say of a good chemist that deftly
performs the procedures that others have invented, that he is a good
artist, with the difference that the word artist is always a praise in the
first case, whereas in the second, it is almost a reproach of only
possessing the subordinate part of his profession''
\autocite[my translation, footnote 1, p. 55]{friedmann1953}.} Discussing the workers of the third section of the
tables project, the famous nineteenth century French engineer Charles Dupin
remarked that they ``ended up blessing the change that removed them from
hard work, to devote themselves to occupations that called upon the use of
thought'' \autocite[p. 211]{dupin1824}.\footnote{My translation.} Nevertheless, according to
\textcite{daston1994}, by pooling the talent of mathematical genius with the
brute force of mindless calculation, de Prony's project contributed to
demote calculation to the lowest of mental faculties. In fact, until the
mid-nineteenth century, in both French and English usage, \emph{work} and
\emph{mechanical} were associated by referring to the laboring body, so that
mechanizing calculation degraded this activity from its previous status as
a manifestation of mathematical gifts.\footnote{As an example of the importance of calculation, the German-Dutch
mathematician, Ludolph van Ceulen (1540-1610), devoted long years to the
calculation of \(\pi\) to thirty-five places. This was considered such an
accomplishment that \(\pi\) is sometimes referred to in German as Ludolph's
number (\emph{Ludolphsche Zahl}) \autocite[p. 50]{maor1994}.} In this regard, Daston
considers that de Prony's project is a landmark in the history of
intelligence because ``it pushed calculation away from intelligence and
towards work'' \autocite[p. 190]{daston1994}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:org02e9797}

If the mechanization of intelligence began with de Prony's project, its
contemporary significance as precursor to the development of the
programmable computer comes from Charles Babbage, who knew about the
project and used it as inspiration to design a series of powerful
mechanical calculators: the Difference Engine I and II, and the Analytical
Engine. Even though Babbage was 


Babbage is remembered today as the inventor of the Analytical Engine, which
is referred as the first programmable computer.

\section{Weaving Algebraical Patterns}
\label{sec:org3631bb6}

Charles Babbage (1791--1871) was born in Walworth, Surrey close to London,
at a time, when the capital was the commercial and industrial center of
Great Britain. Although he never secured an employment for very long, he
inherited a large estate from his goldsmith turned banker father, which
allowed him to pursue his scientific interests more-or-less independently
of financial constraints. Babbage was one of the eminent nineteenth century
Romantic gentlemen scientists,\footnote{This figure would disappear with the advent of twentieth century
Big Science: massive personnel, lavish government budgets, and hierarchical
organization. See \textcite{mirowski2011}.} joining numerous clubs and societies
to advocate the application of science to different domains. For example,
he co-founded the Analytical Society (1811), the Royal Astronomical Society
(1820), the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1831), and
the Royal Statistical Society (1834). During his life---and even today---he
was regarded primarily as a gifted mathematician, graduating from Cambridge
in 1814, and becoming there professor of mathematics in 1828.\footnote{According to Romano, Babbage never moved to Cambridge nor ever
deliver a lecture there as professor of mathematics
\autocite[p. 387]{romano1982}.} In
fact, one of his most important contributions is the introduction of French
``abstract'' mathematics to Great Britain.\footnote{One of the likely reasons for Great Britain's resistance to
Continental advances in mathematical abstraction was the priority debate
over the discovery of the calculus between Newton and Leibniz. According to
Maor, this controversy discouraged the introduction of the Leibniz's
notation in Great Britain. See \textcite{romano1982}, chapter 9.}

At some point, in the year 1820 or 1821, the Astronomical Society appointed
a committee consisting of John Herschel and Babbage to prepare statistical
tables for astronomical calculations. One evening, while the two men were
tediously verifying the numbers produced by two hired ``computers,''
Babbage exclaimed that he wished ``we could calculate by stem.'' And, this
was Babbage's own account of his source of inspiration for the construction
of a series of calculating machines to automate the production of
statistical tables, the first of which was called the Difference Engine.\footnote{Although the most widely known are Babbage's Difference Engines (I
and II) and the Analytical Engine, he had plans for more calculating
machines.}
This machine derived its name from the method of differences discussed
earlier, which Babbage had \emph{translated} into mechanism through a complex
system of wheels and gears. The Difference Engine was a massive and heavy
machine that received its ``input'' by setting the initial values on the
toothed number wheels, which were, then, activated by a human turning a
crank.\footnote{The machine consisted of several parallel columns of rotating piled
up toothed number wheels. Each column containing \(n\) wheels could represent
a number with  \(n - 1\) decimal places.}

\end{figure}


After completing a working model with six figure-wheels in 1822, he
published an open a letter to Sir Humphry Davy---then President of the
Royal society---to secure government financial assistance. In this letter,
Babbage sketches for the first time the concept of the \emph{mental} division of
labor, citing de Prony's tables project as evidence of the possibility to
mechanize calculation. Babbage explains that the third section of de
Prony's project, whom ``the most laborious part of the operations
devolved'' \autocite[p. 214]{babbage1822}, could be reduced in number of
employees to only twelve by the use of calculating machines: their labor
would be to copy the numbers displayed by the Engine's wheels.

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[212]{babbage1822}}]
The intolerable labour and fatiguing monotony of a continued repetition of
similar arithmetical calculations, first excited the desire, and afterwards
suggested the idea, of a machine, which, by the aid of gravity or any other
moving power, should become a substitute for one of the lowest operations
of human intellect.
\end{displayquote}

As this quote shows, Babbage believed that de Prony's project incorporated
a hierarchy of tasks, of which calculation was the paradigmatic mental
operation that required the least application of intelligence. If
\textcite{daston1994} is correct, the association of mechanism with the
laboring body of low-skilled low-paid laborers was the main factor behind
the loss of prestige of calculation. Daston's claim is important because
there is an ``economic'' tendency to explain away this change in status by
appealing to \emph{scarcity} and the \emph{laws} of supply and demand, but this argument
is misleading. Despite all the rhetoric, should Babbage's machine been
completed, it would have most likely been used by large organizations (as
was the case with the first mass-produced electronic computers in the
twentieth century), for, as Maas argues, its sheer size rendered it
impractical for most everyday scientific applications
\autocite[p. 103]{maas2005}.\footnote{During Babbage's lifetime, only functioning sections of the Engines
were produced, but not a single one was completed in its entirety. In 1991,
a group of researchers constructed a full size Difference Engine II to
prove that such a machine could be built using the materials and
engineering tolerances available to Babbage. See \textcite{swade2000}.} Instead, the Engine contributed to
shape the nineteenth century ideas in Great Britain about intelligence by
showing that what had been thought to be the prerogative of the mind could
be accomplished by mechanism. It was, thus, the lack of social prestige of
mechanism---and its association with the low class of citizens that would
soon become the proletariat---that undermined the social status of
calculation.

Another important aspect of Babbage's work, with major implications for the
construction of his Engines, was his famous book
\citetitle{babbage1832_2009}, which consecrated him as an expert on
industrial production techniques. As he constructed the Difference Engine,
Babbage was forced to turn his attention to the study of machinery and
manufactures because of the precision engineering required to produce the
tolerance levels of the Engine's pieces. After the death of his wife in
1827, Babbage embarked on a long tour to study Europe's best methods of
production, and, back in England in late 1828, he began working on his
famous book on manufactures. The book, published in 1832, discusses de
Prony's project as if resembling a British cotton or silk-mill, thereby
drawing a close analogy not only between mental labor and bodily labor, but
between calculating machine and manufactory.

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[157]{babbage1832_2009}}]
When it is stated that the tables thus computed occupy seventeen large
folio volumes, some idea may perhaps be formed of the labour. From that
part executed by the third class, which may almost be termed mechanical,
requiring the least knowledge and by far the greatest labor, the first
class were entirely exempt. \ldots when the completion of a calculating
engine shall have produced a substitute for the whole of the third section
of computers, the attention of analysts will naturally be directed to
simplifying its application, by a new discussion of the methods of
converting analytical formulae into numbers.
\end{displayquote}

Two years after the book's publication, Babbage began drafting plans for a
more ambitious calculating machine: the Analytical Engine, the precursor to
the modern programmable computer.\footnote{Babbage's Engines were forgotten and then rediscovered in the
middle of the twentieth century, most notably by Howard Aiken, inventor of
the Harvard Mark I. See \textcite{aiken1946}, Introduction. Nevertheless, the
influence of Babbage in the development of the twentieth century electronic
computer is only retrospective. I surmise that despite the long history of
calculating machines, between Leibniz's \emph{Staffelwalze} in the seventeenth
century to \textsc{eniac} in the mid-twentieth century, the influence of
most of these inventions to the development of modern computers is,
unfortunately, only retrospective historical reconstruction.} Unlike the Difference Engine,
which was limited to one operation, the Analytical Engine could be
\emph{programmed} by the use of three types of punched cards---Variable cards,
Number cards, and Operations cards---to perform any series of the four
basic arithmetical operations. Maas's claim that the ``Analytical Engine
incorporates in its design the architecture of a factory'' is not
rhetorical flourish (?), for this new mechanical computer was literally
modeled after the large scale division of labor of English industry and de
Prony's project. Specifically, the Analytical Engine consisted of several
logical sections, the most important of which were the memory, the \emph{Store},
and the central processor, the \emph{Mill}. As their names imply, the Store was
responsible for ``storing'' numbers until they were required (as indicated
by the Variable cards) to be ``milled'' at the Mill. Translated in
mechanical terms, this means that the Store kept a number---represented by
the positions of the piled up toothed wheels in a column---which was
transferred to the Mill when called upon by a calculation. Every operation,
from number input (Number cards), to ordering the sequence of operations
(Operations cards), to number conveyance across the Engine (Variable
cards), was controlled by the three types of punched cards: These were fed
to the Engine as long series of tied up cards that activated the various
levers, which in turn, turned the wheels. What this short description of
the \emph{workings} of the Analytical Engine tries to show is that Babbage's
analogy with a silk mill was not a mere pedagogical expedient but a
reference to the working principles of one object to understand the
functioning of another.\footnote{Understanding the history of any science requires the
identification of the analogies that become engines of discovery for a
period of time. These analogies shed light over certain aspects of an
object, while obscuring others. They may also carry along other habits of
thought from one realm into another. In the transition from mechanical to
electronic calculation, the \emph{human mind} superseded the \emph{factory} as the
analogy used to understand the workings of the machine. This change of
analogical referent had profound consequences for twentieth century
behavioral sciences, which, building on the nineteenth century
neurophysiological reductionism of mind to brain activity, understood the
human mind to be a mechanism akin to an electronic computer, and vice versa} In this regard, it is noteworthy that
Babbage borrowed the idea to use punched cards to \emph{command} the Engine from
the Jacquard loom: A weaving machine that threaded complex patterns in
fabrics by following the instructions codified in the punched cards. These
cards were fed into the loom in long series, which activated a system of
levers that threaded the codified pattern. It was, then, in the context of
analogies between factories and calculating machines that Babbage's friend
Ada Lovelace wrote that ``the Analytical Engine \emph{weaves algebraical patterns}
just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers'' \autocite[p.
25]{lovelace1843}.

From the point of view of the social significance of technology, the
Analytical Engine was important because, if with its predecessor, the
Difference Engine, thoughts on machine intelligence were blue sky
speculations, the new machine, with its more sophisticated automated
systems, elicited discussions about the possibility that it was able to
think---or, at very least, to reproduce those ``lower operations of the
human intellect.'' For example, whereas one Italian engineer who
corresponded with Babbage assured that ``the machine is not a thinking
being, but a simple automaton that performed according to the laws that one
has traced for it'' \autocite[my translation, p. 358]{menabrea1842}, Ada
Lovelace claimed that:

\begin{displayquote}[{\cite[22]{lovelace1843}}]
It were much to be desired, that when mathematical processes pass through
the human brain instead of through the medium of inanimate mechanism, it
were equally a necessity of things that the reasonings connected with
\emph{operations} should hold the same just place as a clear and well-defined
branch of the subject of analysis \ldots
\end{displayquote}

Although Lovelace's interpretation was probably rare at the time, her
identifying intelligence with operations that could be carried out in
different ``hardware'' proved important from the point of view of the
history of intelligence because she drew a parallel between logic,
mechanical operations, and the operations of the mind. This same idea would
surface with the publication in 1954 of George Boole's \emph{Laws of Thought}, in
which he presented Boolean algebra, not just as an abstract  theory of
logic, but as a psychological theory of the operations of the mind. 

What is curious is that this discourse about machine intelligence is
contemporaneous to the submission of a whole class of citizens to the
factory system, the wage form, and the contractualization of labor
relations. As \textcite{schaffer1994} argues, these concerns were central to
the manufacture of the Engine's pieces with the right tolerance levels
because their production required not just more precise tools, but also a
reconfiguration of the social space of production. Specifically, the
production of Babbage's Engines accompanied not only the introduction of
advances in machine tools and engineering techniques, but the disembodiment
of the ownership of skills that had been the property of workers. For
example, the newly introduced automatic lathes could produce more precise
pieces, but their operation implied both a re-training of workers to watch
over the machine and a loss of skill, which was traditionally recognized as
the property of the worker \autocite[p. 214]{schaffer1994}. The automatic
tools appropriated and incorporated the skills of the workers. In this
regard, Schaffer interprets Babbage's 1832 book on manufactures as a work
of industrial intelligence to wrest off technical knowledge from workers,
to be appropriated by Babbage as a kind of proto-manager. This knowledge
was then mobilized to build the tools and the workshops were the Engine's
pieces would be produced. As Schaffer mentions, in Babbage's London, tool
manufacturing followed certain customs regarding production techniques,
``intellectual property'', and control and authority over the production
process. The ``technical'' advances required for producing the Engines were
not innocent, in Schaffer's interpretation, because both the discourse
about the organization of work and the social relations of production had
to be transformed for the construction of the Engines to be possible. Among
the changes Schaffer cites, we can mention the dispute over the property
and the rights over the automatic tooling to produce the pieces of the
Engine, which were traditionally owned by master engineers, and the
relocation, at Babbage's behest, of the workshop to his house (to have
greater control over the surveillance of production). As Schaffer argues,
the ``philosophers of machinery'' promoted rational valuation of work to
render the labor process transparent, and skill measurable and thus payable
according to a wage set in a marketplace. In other words, my interpretation
is not that there was duplicity in the intentions of the ``philosophers of
machinery'', but a genuine belief that the submission of workers to
machinery was good because it promoted the application of reason to social
organization. Workers \emph{seemingly} vanished from the production process of the
new thinking machines. As machines became better at mechanical and mental
tasks, workers were subordinated as appendices to these machines. They
never disappeared but became invisible.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:org7207ad7}

To answer the question in the title of this chapter: No, Adam Smith did not
invent the electronic computer, in the sense that he wasn't involved, even
indirectly, in its development. One common misconception about Smith's
concept of the division of labor is that he is talking primarily about
machinery. But, this is an anachronistic interpretation because what Smith
had in mind was a technology for the organization of labor that would raise
productivity.  


\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:orgc993d40}

For example, will the masses of unemployed drivers become part of
government job-guarantee programs \cite{wray1998_2003} that will in turn put
more pressure on private sector businesses to improve working conditions?
Will the government instead opt to provide incentives to the private sector
to create replacements jobs while providing a basic income to those unable
to be profitable employed by private enterprise? Will this new class of
state dependents become a pariah class that threatens social cohesion? I
think these are the questions that artificial intelligence really brings to
the fore. For as \textcite{mirowski2011} claims, there has been a very big
change in the social organization of American science since the end of the
second world war, passing from a state-led to a private firms-led model of
funding and organization of science. And, if there is one area where this
is most obvious is in artificial intelligence, where big tech giants such
as Google and Facebook are responsible for directing some of the most
important research projects in this domain.

The next step is to link with Herbert Simon, who as founder of the
discipline  of  artificial intelligence .
