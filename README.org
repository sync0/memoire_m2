* Description
Beware, this is still a work in progress!

This repository contains most of the files used to prepare my Master's
thesis. 

The repository contains only two branches: master and testing. I do all my
work on testing, so please look up there for the latest updates. 
** Subject-matter 
Broadly speaking, the idea is to write about issues of communication,
public opinion, democracy, and their relation to the history of economic
thought in the postwar United States. Very likely, these will become the
object of my PhD dissertation as well.
 
This Master's thesis will likely focus on the so-called Dewey-Lippmann
Debate. Perhaps, I will write more on Lippmann than on Dewey because of the
former's (unintended) role in the /Colloque Walter Lippmann./
** Methodology
Undecided.
* Design  
** Typography
I have used Emac's Org mode to plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the
source code interests you, visit the ~org~ files. The ~tex~ files are the
product of the org exporter; I don't deal with them directly. 

The difference between both files with the suffix /draft/ is that 
This thesis has been produced using LaTeX; I have used the KOMA Script class
~scrbook~.
*** Fonts
Only non-proprietary fonts were used: The main font is Linux Libertine,
alongside Linux Biolinum and Liberation Mono.
