* Description
Beware, this is still a work in progress!

This repository contains most of the files used to prepare my Master's
thesis. 

The repository contains only two branches: master and testing. I do all my
work on testing, so please look up there for the latest updates. 
** Subject-matter 
Broadly speaking, the idea is to write about issues of communication,
public opinion, democracy, and their relation to the history of economic
thought in the postwar United States. Very likely, these will become the
object of my PhD dissertation as well.
 
This Master's thesis will likely focus on the so-called Dewey-Lippmann
Debate. Perhaps, I will write more on Lippmann than on Dewey because of the
former's (unintended) role in the /Colloque Walter Lippmann./
** Methodology
Undecided.

* Tools  
** Text Editor
I used Emacs' Org mode to plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the
source code interests you, visit the ~org~ files. 

Using the org exporter, I exported the ~org~ files into ~LaTeX~, and then into pdfs.
** Bibliography Management
I used Mendeley to maintain a bibliography file called ~master.bib~. 
** Typography
I used LaTeX's KOMA Script class ~scrbook~.
*** Fonts
I only used non-proprietary fonts: The main font is Linux Libertine,
alongside Linux Biolinum and Liberation Mono.
* Organization 
This section tracks the progress of my Master's thesis; it is not intended
to provide general advise on writing a thesis. 

I have used these books to write the contents of this section: 
- Zinsser, William, /On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction/.
- Beaud, Michel, /L'art de la these./
 
I believe that reading these books provides enough tools to master with the
"technical" part of the ordeal. Read them before starting to research; they
can prevent squandering days and months chasing after false starts and
/hors-sujets/.

All credit goes to these authors. I have merely adapted their advice to
prepare my thesis.
** File Structure
I have organized all work (planing, research, and writing) in these files:
*** ~todo.org~
This file is a collection of task lists used for planning and scheduling.
It follows this structure (the "stages" are explained [[file:README.org::Preparation][here]]):

Under the heading ~Thesis~, I keep this table to prevent falling behind
deadlines. The estimations are taken from Beaud's /L'art de la thèse./

| *Stage* | *Task*                          | *Spent* | *Remaining* | *Estimated* |

|       | Total (weeks)                 |  0.00 |     31.00 |     31.00 |
|       | Total       (months)          |  0.00 |      7.75 |      7.75 |

Since the table is coded with Emacs' ~org-mode~, this code snippet will
make it interactive:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 #+TBLFM: @>>$3..@>>$>=vsum(@2..@-2);%.2f::@>$3..@>$>=(vsum(@2..@-2))/4;%.2f::@<<$>>..@>>>$>>=$>-$>>>;%.0f::
#+END_EXAMPLE

Just type the number of weeks spent in each stage under the ~Spent~ column,
and the rest will adjust to display the remaining weeks and months. 

The estimations are good enough for the French system, in which a M2
Master's thesis should be prepared in one year. 

This file is not included in the repository because it contains personal

*** ~master.org~
This file (not included in the repository) contains all my research notes;
it follows this structure:

First level headings are the authors, and second level headings are the
texts (books, journal artciles, webpages, etc.). 

I use the ~:lecture:~ tag with ~org-mode~'s custom agenda commands, so I add it
to all first level headings.

Most entries are produced automatically with [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] and ~master.bib~ (a
bibliography file, maintained with [[https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/][Mendeley]], not included in this
repository).

Please look at my [[https://github.com/sync0/sync0_laptop_config/blob/master/.emacs.d/init.org][Emacs' configuration]] for details. And, please excuse the
chaos therein; I am not a proficient coder.
*** ~README.org~
This file is what you are reading now. It introduces the contents of the
~git~ repository where my Master's thesis rests. 
*** ~memoire.org~
This file is the final version of my Master's thesis; it is the source that
produces the pdf. 

I used this file only for preparing what would be the final version of the
thesis, i.e., the writing stage. For all other notes and drafts, l used the
~memoire_draft.org~.
*** ~memoire_draft.org~
This file contains most of the planning notes, research notes, preparatory
notes, and drafts.

Since I use ~git~ for version control, I could dispense with the list of
files titled draft 1, draft 2, /ad nauseam/. Instead, I tagged certain
commits as "drafts". 
** 無 Preparation
I have clustered the steps to complete the Master's thesis in six stages.
*** Stage I
**** Choice of Subject-matter
- [ ] First sifting through the material. 
***** First Questions
What are you trying to answer?
***** Intention
What's the purpose of writing about this subject-matter?
***** Draft of the Outline
- [ ] Redact a provisional outline (check with the thesis adviser).
 
The Outline must be organized around a main question.
*** Stage II 
**** Formulate the /Outline I/ and the /Work Plan/
***** 無 Outline I
The /Outline I/ helps organize and carry out the research. It consists of:
- [ ] Main question.
  - Nodal points. 
- [ ] Secondary questions.
  - Scope and interrelations.
  - Means and methods.
  - Sources.
***** 無 Work Plan
The /Work Plan/ serves to identify the different themes and questions that
should orient the research.

Note: Neither the /Outline I/ nor the /Work Plan/ is the outline of the thesis'
first draft; both are used to structure the research and take preparatory
notes.
****** Methodology
- [ ] Keywords.
- [ ] Debates around the research question.
- [ ] Axes de réflexion.

** Sources
I divided the readings into two categories: read and unread.

Using org mode's priorities, I adopted the following codes:
- ~#A~: To read first. A must read.
- ~#B~: To read because of the importance of the author or what he/she represents.
- ~#C~: Choose whether to read based on the progress of the thesis.
- ~none~: Choose whether to read if there remains any time.
