* Description
Beware, this is still a work in progress!

This repository contains most of the files used to prepare my Master's
thesis. 

The repository contains only two branches: master and testing. I do all my
work on testing, so please look up there for the latest updates. 
** Subject-matter 
Broadly speaking, the idea is to write about issues of communication,
public opinion, democracy, and their relation to the history of economic
thought in the postwar United States. Very likely, these will become the
object of my PhD dissertation as well.
 
This Master's thesis will likely focus on the so-called Dewey-Lippmann
Debate. Perhaps, I will write more on Lippmann than on Dewey because of the
former's (unintended) role in the /Colloque Walter Lippmann./
** Methodology
Undecided.

* Tools  
** Text Editor
I used Emacs' Org mode to plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the
source code interests you, visit the ~org~ files. 

Using the org exporter, I exported the ~org~ files into ~LaTeX~, and then into pdfs.
** Bibliography Management
I used Mendeley to maintain a bibliography file called ~master.bib~. 
** Typography
I used LaTeX's KOMA Script class ~scrbook~.
*** Fonts
I only used non-proprietary fonts: The main font is Linux Libertine,
alongside Linux Biolinum and Liberation Mono.
* File Structure 
This section tracks the progress of my Master's thesis; it is not intended
to provide general advise on writing a thesis. 

I have used these books to write the contents of this section: 
- Zinsser, William, /On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction/.
- Beaud, Michel, /L'art de la these./
 
I believe that reading these books provides enough tools to master with the
"technical" part of the ordeal. Read them before starting to research; they
can prevent squandering days and months chasing after false starts and
/hors-sujets/.

All credit goes to these authors. I have merely adapted their advice to
prepare my thesis.

I have organized all work (planing, research, and writing) in these files:
*** ~todo.org~
This file (not included in the repository) is a collection of task lists used for planning and scheduling.
It follows this structure (the "stages" are explained [[file:README.org::Preparation][here]]):

Under the heading ~Thesis~, I keep this table to prevent falling behind
deadlines. The estimations are taken from Beaud's /L'art de la these/; they
are good enough for the French system, in which a M2 Master's thesis should
be prepared in one year.

Since the table is coded with Emacs' ~org-mode~, this code snippet will
make it interactive:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 #+TBLFM: @>>$3..@>>$>=vsum(@2..@-2);%.2f::@>$3..@>$>=(vsum(@2..@-2))/4;%.2f::@<<$>>..@>>>$>>=$>-$>>>;%.0f::
#+END_EXAMPLE

Just type the number of weeks spent in each stage under the ~Spent~ column,
and the rest will adjust (with ~C-c C-c~) to display the remaining weeks and months. 

*** ~master.org~
This file (not included in the repository) contains my specific research notes per
author per text; it follows this structure:

First level headings are the authors, and second level headings are the
texts (books, journal artciles, webpages, etc.). 

I use the ~:lecture:~ tag with ~org-mode~'s custom agenda commands, so I add it
to all first level headings.

Most entries are produced automatically with [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] and ~master.bib~ (a
bibliography file, maintained with [[https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/][Mendeley]], not included in this
repository).

Please look at my [[https://github.com/sync0/sync0_laptop_config/blob/master/.emacs.d/init.org][Emacs' configuration]] for details. And, please excuse the
chaos therein; I am not a proficient coder.
*** ~README.org~
This file is what you are reading now. It introduces the contents of the
~git~ repository where my Master's thesis rests. 
*** ~memoire.org~
This file is the final version of my Master's thesis; it is the source code
that produces the pdf.

I only used this file to prepare what would be the final version of the
thesis, i.e., the writing stage. For all other notes and drafts, l used the
~memoire_draft.org~.
*** ~memoire_draft.org~
This file contains most of the preparatory notes, and drafts.

Since I use ~git~ for version control, I could dispense with the list of
files titled draft 1, draft 2, /ad nauseam/. Instead, I tagged certain
commits as "drafts". 
*** ~notes.org~
This file is a "travel log" to track the development of the thesis and
preserve all disparate ideas that occur to me. Most research notes are
stored herein.  

I was inspired to create this file by a chapter of Bernard Lahire's
/Tableaux de famille: Heurs et malheurs scolaires en milieux populaires/ that
discussed the importance of writing as a reflexive activity. I believe it
is important to constantly write down one's thoughts to imbue the
text---that ineffable entity---with personality. Writing without
personality (i.e., most writing) is not worth reading. And, writing that is
not worth reading is absolutely demoralizing.
* 無 Stages to Complete this Master's Thesis
I have clustered the steps to complete the Master's thesis in six stages.
** Stage I
*** Choice of Subject-matter
Meditate these two questions: What are you trying to answer? What's the
purpose of writing about this subject-matter?

- [ ] Choose the subject-matter.
*** First Sifting
Identify how many texts (one, two, a thousand?) there are to read on the subject.

To quickly identify the key texts, peruse and cross check the
bibliographies of those texts that catch your attention. If a text is cited
several times therein, it is an important text. After identifying a long
list of texts, prioritize their reading. For this thesis, I have adopted
the hierarchy explained in the section Readings.

When approaching a text, don't read everything, and don't read as a
machine. 

  - [ ] Identify the key texts---those to be read and analyzed as
    soon as possible because of their direct relation to the subject-matter.
  - [ ] Identify the key authors---those to be read, heard, or consulted with.
** Stage II 
*** Draft of the Framework
For convenience's sake, I call /Framework/ the group consisting of the main
question, the nodal points, the secondary questions, the research
hypotheses, the scope and interrelations, the methodology, and the sources.
The Framework is a compass to guide the research; it will prevent sailing
astray into ancillary topics.

For now, we define a provisional Framework consisting of the main question,
the research hypotheses, and the methodology. 

The heart of the Framework is the Main Question---the guiding light to
research and (later) writing. This is the /most/ important aspect of the
thesis work. Working out a sloppy question is akin to pursuing a mirage in
the desert. The only way to discriminate good questions from sloppy
questions is by reading about methodology in your own field and perhaps
some philosophy of science.

Remember to restrain that impulse to delve into every debate around the
Main Question in the thesis. This is both wasteful and impossible.

We check with the thesis adviser to incorporate his comments and criticism
into the Framework.

(I couldn't find a good translation for /axes d'interpretation/, but I had to
include it as an essential part of the methodology: This term refers to the
theoretical perspective---the lens, the angle of attack---used to appraise
the Main Question. Spend some time thinking about this matter. Despite the
American belief on the possibility of simply /stating the facts/, serious
academic work should be aware of its own methodology, its limits, its
context. Should I be right, a sizable portion of what passes for academic
writing would be denounced for its laziness and redundancy. Finding out the
degree to which this evil afflicts your academic department is left to you,
oh reader, as an exercise.)

- [ ] Write the Draft of the Framework:
  - [ ] Main Question.
  - [ ]Scope and interrelations.
    - [ ] Nodal points. 
  - [ ] Research hypotheses.
  - [ ] Methodology.
    - [ ] Debates & controversies around the main question.
    - [ ] Axes d'interpretation.
- [ ] Before proceeding, check the provisional Framework with the thesis
  adviser.
*** Framework 
Incorporating the thesis adviser's comments, define a complete Framework:
  - [ ] Main Question.
    - [ ] Secondary questions.
  - [ ]Scope and interrelations.
    - [ ] Nodal points. 
  - [ ] Research hypotheses.
  - [ ] Methodology.
    - [ ] Debates & controversies around the main question.
    - [ ] Axes d'interpretation.
  - [ ] Sources.
    - [ ] Update list of key texts.
    - [ ] Update list of key authors.
*** Research Plan
The /Research Plan/ serves to identify the different themes and questions that
should orient the research. 

Do not confuse the /Research Plan/ with the /Writing Plan/. The former is a guide
to research, whereas the latter is a guide to writing. In other words, the
Research Plan is not supposed to constitute the skeleton of the thesis' first
draft. 

Discuss with the thesis adviser on the general orientation, and present
him/her with the Framework and the Research Plan. Do likewise with a group of
selected readers.

In /L'art de la these/, Michel Beaud recommends finding a consistent group of
readers to comment and criticize the thesis work at different stages.
Following his advise, I have searched for a knowledgeable reader (in the
subject-matter of the thesis) and an unknowledgeable but /good writer/
reader. The former should focus (tell him/her explicitly to do so) on content, the
latter on style and logic (of the argumentation). 

- [ ] Present the thesis adviser with the Framework and the Research Plan.
- [ ] Present the selected readers with the Framework and the Research Plan.
*** Research 
This is the time for the Final Sifting. Be absolutely careful with this
stage---lack of diligence could result in missing a key text or a key
author. Don't waste precious time reading mediocre books; some expound the
same argument but better. The only thing worse than finding about a key
text while writing the first draft of the thesis, is being told about it
during the defense jury. Do /not/ let that happen!

The same advice for the First Sifting applies: When approaching a text,
don't read everything, and don't read as a machine.

Since time is scarce, when choosing whether to read a text, ask yourself:
Does this text provide any robust argument to address the main question?
Does it clarify or complement the question somehow?

Read carefully, and take copious notes.

I stored all research notes in ~master.org~, ~notes.org~ and ~memoire_draft.org~. 

Notes about specific authors and texts are in ~master.org~. Notes about
specific sections (Framework, Research Plan, Outline, Writing Plan, Drafts,
etc.) are in ~memoire_draft.org~. Thoughts, inspiring ideas, meditations, and
questions (i.e., most notes) are in ~notes.org~.

- [ ] Final Sifting:
  - [ ] Update list of key texts.
  - [ ] Update list of key authors.
- [ ] If necessary, update any component of the Framework, based on your
  findings.
** Stage III 
*** Draft of the Outline.
(Instead of /Framework/ and /Outline/, Beaud uses the terms /Problematique I/ and
/Problematique II/. I found his formulation confusing; thus, I oppose the
Framework and Research Plan to the Outline and Writing Plan to discriminate
between two different stages in the preparation of the thesis. Although I
could have used the term Framework II for the Outline, I thought Outline
better reflects its function to organize the text of the first draft of the
thesis. Unfortunately, the term Outline is potentially confusing because it
alludes to the venerable ~I: Introduction~, ~II: Body~, ~III: Conclusion~ schema
of high school English composition classes. This is /not/ what is meant. In
fact, do yourself a favor and forget that puerile schema. Or better, use it
sparingly for the plug-and-chug canned writing of the academic profession's
due diligence (exams, research proposals, etc).)

The Outline is the group consisting of the Main Question, the Directing
Idea, and the Argument (around the directing idea); it is a compass to
writing the first draft of the thesis. 

The Directing Idea is the one-line response to the Main Question; it should
structure the Argument. 

The Argument is the set of logical steps that respond to the Main
Question. 

By this advanced stage, it is normal to have witnessed the evolution of the
Main Question based on the results of the research. After all, it is
pretentious to think it possible to foresee /a priori/ the findings of
research. Should this be false, at least in the social sciences, most
research would be tautological.

- [ ] Write the Draft of the Outline:
  - [ ] Update the Main Question.
  - [ ] Directing idea. 
  - [ ] Argument.
*** Draft of  Writing Plan. 
The Writing Plan structures the Argument into parts, chapters, sections,
subsections, etc. You must provide provisional titles to these structural
elements---they constitute the skeleton of the first draft of the thesis.

I repeat: the Research Plan is /not/ the Writing Plan; the former addresses
you, the researcher, while the latter addresses the audience. Therefore,
the Writing Plan should be produced thinking about an angle of attack that
captivates the interest of the reader and convinces him/her that the
Argument is right. Wielding the Directing Idea as a torch, you should guide
the reader throughout the structural elements, each with their own Main
Idea. After lighting up all the Main Ideas in the structural elements, the
reader should see the light---the answer to the Main Question.

- [ ] Draft of the Writing Plan.
- [ ] Discuss these elements with the thesis adviser.
- [ ] Discuss these elements with the selected readers.
*** Additional Research
I hesitate to place this stage in this position, but sometimes it is
necessary. Should anybody (thesis adviser, selected readers) point out any
major holes in the Argument, this is the stage to paper over them. 

But this is /not/ the time to rebuild the house from the foundations. Should
that be the case, you have been sloppy with the Final Sifting. Pray to
Saint Thomas Aquinas (or your favorite deity), take a walk in the park, and
tinker with the Directing Idea. If kicking didn't work so far, try
punching. 
*** Draft of the First Draft of the Thesis.

* Readings
I divided the readings into two categories: read and unread.

Using org mode's priorities, I adopted the following codes:
- ~#A~: Key text: A must read.
- ~#B~: Important text: Read this because of the importance of the author or what he/she represents.
- ~#C~: Ancillary text: Choose whether to read this based on the progress of the thesis.
- ~none~: Boundary text: Choose whether to read this if there remains any time.
