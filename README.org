This repository contains most files used to prepare my Master's thesis.

This is a work in progress!

* File Structure 
I have organized all work (planing, research, and writing) in these files:
*** ~README.org~
This is the file you are reading now; it describes the contents of my
Master's thesis ~git~ repository.
*** ~todo.org~
This file (not included in the repository) is a collection of task lists
used for planning and scheduling.

# It follows this structure (the "stages" are explained [[file:README.org::Preparation][here]]): 
*** ~master.org~
This file (not included in the repository) contains my research notes. 

# it follows this structure:

# First level headings are the authors, and second level headings are the
# texts (books, journal artciles, webpages, etc.). 

# I use the ~:lecture:~ tag with ~org-mode~'s custom agenda commands, so I add it
# to all first level headings.

Most entries are produced automatically with John Kitchin's Emacs package
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] and a bibliography file, ~master.bib~, maintained with [[https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/][Mendeley]]. 

For details, please look at my [[https://github.com/sync0/sync0_laptop_config/blob/master/.emacs.d/init.org][Emacs' configuration]]. And, excuse me for the
chaos therein.
*** ~memoire.org~
This file is the final version of my Master's thesis; it is the source code
that produces the pdf.

I only used this file to prepare what would be the final version of the
thesis. For all other notes, l used the ~memoire_draft.org~.

Since I use ~git~ for version control, I could dispense with the list of
files titled draft 1, draft 2, /ad nauseam/. Instead, I tagged certain
commits as "drafts". 
*** ~memoire_draft.org~
This file contains most of the preparatory notes. So, it is not an actual
draft, but a collection of intermediary writings before the preparation of
the first draft of the thesis.
*** ~notes.org~
This file is a collection of all my research notes; it is organized by day
and by week. 
*** ~log.org~
This file is a "travel log" to track the development of the thesis. 

I was inspired to create this file by a chapter of Bernard Lahire's
/Tableaux de famille: Heurs et malheurs scolaires en milieux populaires/ that
discussed the importance of writing as a reflexive activity. I believe it
is important to constantly write down one's thoughts to imbue the
text---that ineffable entity---with personality. Writing without
personality (i.e., most writing) is not worth reading. And, writing that is
not worth reading is absolutely demoralizing.
* Tools  
** Text Editor
I used Emacs' Org mode to plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the
source code interests you, visit the ~org~ files. 

Using the org exporter, I exported the ~org~ files into ~LaTeX~, and then into pdfs.
** Bibliography Management
I used Mendeley to maintain a bibliography file called ~master.bib~. 
** Typography
I used LaTeX's KOMA Script class ~scrbook~.
*** Fonts
I only used non-proprietary fonts: The main font is Linux Libertine,
alongside Linux Biolinum and Liberation Mono.
* Progress Timetable 
I keep this table to prevent falling behind deadlines. The estimations are
taken from Beaud's /L'art de la these/; they are good enough for the French
system, in which a M2 Master's thesis should be prepared in one year.
