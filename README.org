* Description
Beware, this is still a work in progress!

This repository contains most of the files used to prepare my Master's
thesis. 

The repository contains only two branches: master and testing. I do all my
work on testing, so please look up there for the latest updates. 
** Subject-matter 
Broadly speaking, the idea is to write about issues of communication,
public opinion, democracy, and their relation to the history of economic
thought in the postwar United States. Very likely, these will become the
object of my PhD dissertation as well.
 
This Master's thesis will likely focus on the so-called Dewey-Lippmann
Debate. Perhaps, I will write more on Lippmann than on Dewey because of the
former's (unintended) role in the /Colloque Walter Lippmann./

* Tools  
** Text Editor
I used Emacs' Org mode to plan, draft, and write the thesis. If the
source code interests you, visit the ~org~ files. 

Using the org exporter, I exported the ~org~ files into ~LaTeX~, and then into pdfs.
** Bibliography Management
I used Mendeley to maintain a bibliography file called ~master.bib~. 
** Typography
I used LaTeX's KOMA Script class ~scrbook~.
*** Fonts
I only used non-proprietary fonts: The main font is Linux Libertine,
alongside Linux Biolinum and Liberation Mono.
* File Structure 
I have organized all work (planing, research, and writing) in these files:
*** ~todo.org~
This file (not included in the repository) is a collection of task lists used for planning and scheduling.
It follows this structure (the "stages" are explained [[file:README.org::Preparation][here]]):

** Stage II
** Stage III
** Stage IV
** Stage V

Under the heading ~Thesis~, I keep this table to prevent falling behind
deadlines. The estimations are taken from Beaud's /L'art de la these/; they
are good enough for the French system, in which a M2 Master's thesis should
be prepared in one year.

| *Stage* | *Task*                          | *Spent* | *Remaining* | *Estimated* |

| *VI*    | Defense                       |       |         0 |           |

|       | Total (weeks)                 |  0.00 |     31.00 |     31.00 |
|       | Total       (months)          |  0.00 |      7.75 |      7.75 |

Since the table is coded with Emacs' ~org-mode~, this code snippet will
make it interactive:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 #+TBLFM: @>>$3..@>>$>=vsum(@2..@-2);%.2f::@>$3..@>$>=(vsum(@2..@-2))/4;%.2f::@<<$>>..@>>>$>>=$>-$>>>;%.0f::
#+END_EXAMPLE

Just type the number of weeks spent in each stage under the ~Spent~ column,
and the rest will adjust (with ~C-c C-c~) to display the remaining weeks and months. 

*** ~master.org~
This file (not included in the repository) contains my specific research notes per
author per text; it follows this structure:

First level headings are the authors, and second level headings are the
texts (books, journal artciles, webpages, etc.). 

I use the ~:lecture:~ tag with ~org-mode~'s custom agenda commands, so I add it
to all first level headings.

Most entries are produced automatically with [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] and ~master.bib~ (a
bibliography file, maintained with [[https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/][Mendeley]], not included in this
repository).

Please look at my [[https://github.com/sync0/sync0_laptop_config/blob/master/.emacs.d/init.org][Emacs' configuration]] for details. And, please excuse the
chaos therein; I am not a proficient coder.
*** ~README.org~
This is the file you are reading now; it introduces the contents of the ~git~
repository where my Master's thesis rests.
*** ~memoire.org~
This file is the final version of my Master's thesis; it is the source code
that produces the pdf.

I only used this file to prepare what would be the final version of the
thesis, i.e., the writing stage. For all other notes and drafts, l used the
~memoire_draft.org~.
*** ~memoire_draft.org~
This file contains most of the preparatory notes, and drafts.

Since I use ~git~ for version control, I could dispense with the list of
files titled draft 1, draft 2, /ad nauseam/. Instead, I tagged certain
commits as "drafts". 
*** ~notes.org~
This file is a "travel log" to track the development of the thesis and
preserve all disparate ideas that occur to me. Most research notes are
stored herein.  

I was inspired to create this file by a chapter of Bernard Lahire's
/Tableaux de famille: Heurs et malheurs scolaires en milieux populaires/ that
discussed the importance of writing as a reflexive activity. I believe it
is important to constantly write down one's thoughts to imbue the
text---that ineffable entity---with personality. Writing without
personality (i.e., most writing) is not worth reading. And, writing that is
not worth reading is absolutely demoralizing.
